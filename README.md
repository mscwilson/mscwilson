### Miranda Making Things

I am a recent graduate from the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) software development bootcamp. I love Ruby, backend things, ActiveRecord, React Native, and TDD.  

Read the full details about my bootcamp experience on [my blog](http://www.mirandawilson.tech/blog/). I mainly post about technical details that have interested or challenged me, as well as the occasional walkthrough (e.g. deploying to Heroku), and whatever music I was listening to at the time.

Please feel free to contact me if you have a cool job vacancy, or a fun project to collaborate on! Check out my CV [here](https://github.com/mscwilson/curriculum-vitae). I'm based in London, UK.
