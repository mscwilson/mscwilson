### Miranda Making Things

I am a recent graduate from the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) software development bootcamp. I love Ruby, backend things, React Native, and TDD.  

Read the full details about my bootcamp experience on [my blog](http://www.mirandawilson.tech/blog/). I mainly post about technical details that have interested or challenged me, as well as the occasional walkthrough (e.g. deploying to Heroku), and whatever music I was listening to at the time.

My current to do list:
* learn Python properly
* try out making an API
* make a React Native mobile app with a backend
* decide whether to stick with Sublime Text or VS Code
* **get a job**

Please feel free to contact me if you have a cool job vacancy, or a fun project to collaborate on! I'm based in London, UK.
